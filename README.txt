	VOTE OF THANKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		I would like to thank to my mentor, Bingtao & my parents for supporting me and providing me adequate knowledge for completion of this project. Without them I don't think my project would be as it is now. I would like to thanks to Daniel Eden for his animate.css file which i used for animating some of my elements in webpage.

		This project is purely based upon HTML, CSS and JS. No third party libraries were used (except for animate.css by Daniel Eden). Development is still in progress :)
