-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		I would like to thank to my mentor, Bingtao & my parents for supporting me and providing me adequate knowledge for completion of this project. Without them I don't think my project would be as it is now. I would like to thanks to Daniel Eden for his animate.css file which i used for animating some of my elements in webpage.
